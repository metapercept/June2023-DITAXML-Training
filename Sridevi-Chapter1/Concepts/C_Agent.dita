        <p>Marvel Enterprise Monitoring Agents are installed on the systems whose applications or
            resources you want to monitor. The monitoring agent collects the monitored data, and
            passes it to the Marvel Enterprise Monitoring Server to which it is connected. The
            client gathers the current values of the monitored properties, or attributes, and
            displays them in views. It can also test the values against a threshold and display an
            event indicator when that threshold is exceeded.</p>
