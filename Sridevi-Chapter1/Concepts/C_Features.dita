    <shortdesc>The Marvel Enterprise Portal gives you a single point of control for managing the
        resources your applications rely on, including a range of operating systems, servers,
        databases, platforms, and web components. For example, a typical IT network might have a web
        server on Windows, an application server and database on UNIX, and a transaction processor
        on CICSÂ® on the mainframe. The Marvel Enterprise Portal brings all these views together in a
        single window so that you can see when any aspect of your network is not working as
        expected. Your IBM Marvel Monitoring products use the portal interface with these major
        features, and you can find demos for many of them on developer works in the <xref

                            <entry>Marvel Enterprise Portal presents information in a single pane of
                                glass called a workspace, which consists of one or more views.
                                Monitoring data is retrieved at regular intervals and the results
                                sent to the workspace in the form of chart and table views. You can
                                start monitoring activity and system status immediately with the
                                predefined workspaces. With just a few clicks of the mouse, you can
                                tailor your own workspaces to look at specific conditions, display
                                critical threshold values in red, and filter incoming data so you
                                see only what matters.</entry>
