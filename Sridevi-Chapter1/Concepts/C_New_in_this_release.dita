                        platforms. Support for the most current Extended Support Release versions of

                    <dd>It is now possible to connect the Marvel Enterprise Portal to multiple IBM
                        Marvel Monitoring domains from a single browser instance. Prior to release
                        6.3, if you needed to manage multiple domains using the Marvel Enterprise
                        Portal, you were required to either launch separate browser instances (one
                        for each domain), or use alternate client deployment modes (such as a
                        desktop client or Java WebStart). Minor changes were also made to the Marvel
                        Enterprise Portal for content improvements. New features and capability
                        enhancements were made to the Marvel Management Services. For more
